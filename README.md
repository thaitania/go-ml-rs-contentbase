# Pro & Con in Content-based Recommendation

## Pro: what's the Content-based is GOOD

1. It's don't need data of other user.
2. It's able to recommend user what they want by using their interest.
3. We able to recommend new & unpopular item but user maybe want.
4. We can explain to user why they want to have this item.

## Con: what's the Content-based is BAD

1. It's can't recommend outside user's content profile.
2. If User not choose something we can't recommend what they want. (because we don't have data of user profile)
3. We can't predict other user by using other user profile data.
4. if we have a little item in item list, user will see the same item.
